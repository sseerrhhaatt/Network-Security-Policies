# 1)	Getting Started & Introduction 
Rapid developments in information technologies and the widespread use of the internet have made ensuring the security of computer networks and servers at the enterprise level a critical issue. In particular, university campus networks play a vital role in teaching, research, and administration. For this reason, universities allocate significant budgets and make serious investments in order to make these networks more secure and stable. However, generally, the security measures taken focus on preventing attacks from outside the organization, while internal network security and control are neglected. This highlights the need for a holistic protection system that fully addresses network security. Research indicates that security policies play a central and critical role in ensuring network security. Security policies are considered as a subset of the security of computer systems, focusing on concepts such as intrusion detection, network traffic analysis, and continuous monitoring of the network. Internal or external attacks or user errors can lead to unauthorized access or modification of the organization's critical information. Therefore, corporate networks should be protected against internal or external threats under the basic principles of information security such as confidentiality, integrity and accessibility. In this context, the creation and implementation of network security policies is critical for organizations to ensure information security. While planning is of great importance in the formulation of policies, the security requirements of the institution should be meticulously considered. Network security policies are a set of written rules that define how a secure computer network should be and determine the use of resources on the network. Instead of collecting all these policies in a single document, it is recommended to create an information security policy that includes general rules and to associate this document with other sub-policies.

  a)	The Importance of Network Security Policies
Security policy for organizations refers to the situation that includes a set of rules and determines the behavior of a system. This policy specifies who can use a service and under what conditions, how information is provided to the service and its use. The corporate security policy, on the other hand, is a statement of the official rules that must be followed by those who are allowed to access technology infrastructure and information assets. A secure system is one that starts operating in an authorized state and does not enter an unauthorized state. Network security policies fulfill the principles of confidentiality, integrity and accessibility on devices that provide internet security. These policies ensure network security using mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, web filtering, and application control. However, caution is required in the process of creating rules on devices. Defining different rules for the same goal can cause contradictions and increase the complexity of the network. For this reason, filtering-oriented network security policies should be classified in a comprehensive way to avoid conflicting rules. In order to ensure network and system security, first of all, risk analysis should be made and a security policy should be created accordingly. The security policy should include sections such as general description, purpose, scope, principles, rules, definitions and update procedures. Among the security measures, the use of firewalls in large-scale networks is important. However, as the network grows, the increase in rules and the emergence of contradictions can increase complexity. To prevent this situation, tools such as "Firewall Policy Advisor" have been developed that discover anomalies related to firewall rules. These tools minimize weaknesses that can arise from misconfiguration of rules.

# 2)	Establishment of Network Security Policies
Establishing network security policies is a critical step in increasing the resilience of organizations against cyber threats. The steps followed to create these policies are detailed below:
  a)	Risk Assessment: Identification of Network Security Vulnerabilities
As a first step, it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the organization's network infrastructure and identify existing security vulnerabilities. In this process, vulnerability scans should be performed to examine the hardware and software in the network, network traffic analysis, and detect security vulnerabilities and potential threats. This assessment will guide you in which areas and how security policies should be established.
  b)	Setting Policies and Standards: Writing Security Policies and Setting Standards
In the light of the information obtained as a result of the risk assessment, the security objectives and requirements of the institution are determined. At this stage, security policies are written and network security standards are determined. The policies detail data security, access control, intrusion detection, and other security measures. For example, a firewall policy that determines what network traffic is acceptable or a password policy that specifies password complexity requirements can be created.
  c)	Training of Personnel: Transferring Safety Policies and Standards to Employees
Training employees is of great importance for the successful implementation of the established policies and standards. At this stage, security policies and standards should be conveyed to employees in detail. Trainings should be organized to increase security awareness and ensure that employees comply with policies and standards.
  d)	Monitoring and Evaluation: Regular Review and Update of Policies
Policies and standards need to be regularly monitored and evaluated to ensure their effectiveness. Network security policies must be constantly reviewed and updated in accordance with technological changes, new threats, and organizational needs. In addition, regular audits should be conducted to ensure that policies are being implemented appropriately.

# 3)	Setting and Maintaining Data Security Standards
Setting data security standards is a critical step in protecting and securing sensitive data. These standards regulate access to data, specify encryption methods, and include data management policies. Here are the key steps for setting and maintaining data security standards:
  a)	Identifying Sensitive Data: Determining What Data Needs to Be Protected
As a first step, it is necessary to classify the data owned by the organization and identify sensitive data. This includes identifying sensitive data such as customer information, financial data, internal strategic information, etc. This step plays an important role in determining which data needs to be protected and which data needs higher levels of protection.
b)	Effective Data Encryption Methods: Establishing and Implementing Data Encryption Standards
Effective encryption methods need to be identified to protect sensitive data. In this step, data encryption standards are created and how they are enforced. Encryption requirements are defined in data storage, transmission and backup processes. For example, industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) can be used.
c)	Authorization and Access Control: Policies for Regulating Access to Data
Controlling access to data is ensured by authorization policies and access controls. In this step, which users can access which data, their access level, and authorization policies are determined. By using methods such as role-based access control, a structure is created where only authorized persons can access certain data.
d)	Data Backup and Recovery Strategies:
Data security standards include data backup and recovery processes. Regular backup policies and data recovery strategies are set to prevent data loss. This ensures that data is restored quickly and effectively in the event of a potential data loss.
e)	Continuous Monitoring and Update:
The established standards should be constantly monitored and updated. Standards should be revised and updated when necessary in line with technological developments, new threats or regulations.
f)	Staff Training and Awareness:
In order for the standards to be applied effectively, employees should be regularly trained and made aware. Regular training on data security policies and standards increases staff compliance with standards.
Setting and maintaining data security standards plays a fundamental role in protecting data, one of the most valuable assets of organizations. These standards promote a culture of data security and help prevent potential security breaches. Successful completion of these steps ensures effective protection of sensitive data. Data security standards, which are constantly updated and reviewed, should be maintained in accordance with changing threats and data management needs.

4)	Types of Network Security:
The following list lists the different types of network security:
•	Firewalls
•	Access control
•	Virtual private networks (VPNs)
•	Intrusion prevention systems
•	Wireless security
•	Application security
•	Behavioral analysis

a)	Firewalls:
Firewalls are services or devices that act as protections, which are responsible for deciding which web page, pop-up, and other services enter and exit a network. Firewalls use a set of predefined rules that help block or allow traffic, depending on the requirements. Firewalls may be required for software, hardware, or both, depending on the needs of the system.
b)	Access Control:
Access control allows businesses to prevent potential attackers from leaking confidential information, preventing unauthorized devices and users from accessing the given network. This ensures that only users who are allowed to work with the given resources can access the network.
c)	Virtual Private Networks:
A VPN typically uses the internet to encrypt the connection between an endpoint device and a network. In addition, VPN enables professionals to verify the communication between the network and the device. This results in the creation of an encrypted and secure tunnel over the internet.
d)	Intrusion Prevention Systems:
Intrusion prevention systems find and prevent attacks by scanning network traffic. This is done by using databases of attack techniques familiar to professionals and correlating them with network activities.
e)	Wireless Security:
Wired networks are not as secure as wireless networks. It requires you to control the devices and users who can access your company's network. That's why it's important to have wireless security, especially when cybercriminals are quickly targeting your business to leak confidential information.
f)	Application Security:
Application security monitors and locks down weak points of an application. It includes a range of software, hardware, and processes that are easily targeted by hackers to infiltrate your network.
g)	Behavioral Analytics:
If you want to be able to detect anomalies and various network breaches as soon as they occur, you need to have a clear idea of the normal behavior of your network. There are several behavioral analysis tools available that automatically detect abnormal activity.

5)	Network Security Attack:
A network security attack is a malicious attempt by cybercriminals to compromise the security of a network. These attacks are the most important reason for the need for network security. Network security is responsible for preventing these attacks on the network infrastructure.
Types of Attacks in Network Security:
Some of the different types of network security attacks are as follows:
Virus: It  is a downloadable malicious file, and once opened by a user, it begins to replace the codes on the computer with its own code sets. When it spreads, the system files on the computer become corrupted, which can cause the files of other computer systems on the network to become corrupted.
Malware: It is among the most harmful and rapid types of malicious attacks that help gain unauthorized access to a system or system network. Malware is often self-replicating; That is, when one system is corrupted, the malware easily disrupts all computer systems that connect to the network via the internet. In the case of malware, even an external device connected to the system can be corrupted.
Worm: Enters a  specific system without the need for a user. If a user is running an application that is not very powerful, then any hacker using the same internet connection can easily send malware to that application. Without the user's knowledge, the application can accept and run this malware over the internet, which can lead to the creation of a worm.
Packet Sniffer: If a user places a passive receiver in a wireless transmitter region, they see a copy of the packets being transmitted. Usually, these packages consist of confidential organizational data, trade secrets, etc., that can reach the package recipient. Cryptography is the best way to prevent these types of network security attacks.
Phishing: This is one of the most common forms of attacks on network security. Hackers send emails to users that pretend to be from a known source, such as investors and bankers, creating a sense of urgency to grab users' attention or excite them. These emails are likely to contain malicious attachments or links that ask users to share confidential data.
Compromised Key: When a hacker obtains a network security key, they use a compromised key that acts as a tool to extract sensitive data and gain unauthorized access to secure data. This key consists of a code or number that helps in the interpretation of secure data without any notification to the sender or receiver.
Botnet: It  is a malicious software that attacks a series of computers that are connected to each other through a private network. Hackers access and control all systems on that network without the owner's knowledge. All computers in this network are called zombies, which, according to the hacker's instructions, disrupt a large number of devices.
DoS: DoS is known as denial of service. This attack is capable of partially or completely destroying users' networks. DoS can also attack even an entire IT infrastructure, making it unusable for real users.

6)	Conclusion and Recommendations:

Establishing and enforcing network security policies and standards is critical for organizations in today's digital world. These policies play a fundamental role in ensuring data security by creating a network infrastructure that is resilient to cyber threats.
a)	The Importance of Network Security Policies and Standards
Network security policies are essential for protecting organizations' assets and creating defense mechanisms against cyberattacks. With the rise of threats such as data leaks, ransomware, phishing, etc., it is vital to establish the right policies and standards. It strengthens the organization's defense systems by providing guidance in areas such as policies, data security, access control, and intrusion prevention.
b)	Evaluation of Proposed Solutions and Conclusions
Open-source network security solutions are noted for their low cost and often flexible nature. However, they can cause performance issues in large-scale organizations. The use of these solutions should be evaluated by considering their compatibility with the needs and infrastructure of the institution.
For example, open source IPS/IDS solutions such as Snort stand out for their flexibility and broad community support. However, it can lead to performance issues on large networks. Open-source vulnerability scanning tools, such as OpenVAS, come with comprehensive scanning capabilities but can produce false positives. The choice of these solutions shows that factors such as the needs of the institution, staff competence and budget should be taken into account.
c)	Future Developments and Recommendations
Network security is an ever-evolving field. For future developments, the integration of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning into security solutions is important. These technologies can be more effective at detecting and preventing attacks quickly. In addition, the implementation of continuous training and awareness programs plays a critical role in ensuring that employees are aware of safety and that policies/standards are implemented. In conclusion, establishing network security policies and standards is important to be prepared not only for current threats but also for evolving threats in the future. Choosing the right solutions and keeping them constantly up-to-date helps organizations to become more robust in terms of security.
7)	Real-world examples:
Data Leak Event:
An organization realizes that a database containing sensitive customer information has been leaked. This indicates that data security policies are weak and cyber attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities within the network. There are security vulnerabilities in encryption standards, data backup policies, and lack of access control.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention:
An organization detects and quickly responds to a DDoS (Denial of Service) attack thanks to network monitoring and intrusion detection systems. This demonstrates the effectiveness of network security policies in detecting and preventing attacks. The effects of attacks are minimized thanks to preventive measures such as network monitoring solutions and firewalls.
Security Breaches Due to Employee Errors:
An employee accidentally sends a sensitive document to the wrong recipient. This highlights a lack of education and awareness. It turns out that employees should be aware of security policies and be careful about data sharing. Such situations indicate the need to update policies and training.
Impact of Security Updates:
An organization encounters a situation where timely updates to its security software are not made. This is due to the fact that security gaps in systems are not closed. It is emphasized that updates should be followed and implemented regularly.
These real-world scenarios illustrate how network security policies and solutions can be effective in real life. Each scenario reveals different weaknesses and policy gaps, helping organizations review their security strategies and identify areas where they need to improve.
